# RekichoLand-bot

A simple discord bot I made for my private server. Currently, its only feature is providing temporary text channels that people in a voice call can use, so they don't bother the rest of the server members.

## Pre-Requisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

In development, run the `dev` script, which will hot reload your code.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

In "production", just run the `start` script. You'll probably want something like `pm2` to make the bot start automatically after booting your computer.

```bash
$ npm start
```
